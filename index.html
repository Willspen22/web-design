        <article class="w3-container w3-amber">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The band formed in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1964 when seven school friends decided to perform together
                as an instrumental jazz and soul group named the Jazziacs. Among them were Robert "Kool" Bell on bass,
                his brother Ronald Bell on keyboards, Robert "Spike" Mickens on trumpet, Dennis "D.T." Thomas on
                saxophone, Ricky West on keyboards, George Brown on drums, and Charles Smith guitar. All of them, except
                Smith, attended Lincoln High School in Jersey City. Robert Bell had given himself the nickname "Kool" as
                a way of adapting to the street gangs in his neighborhood after moving from Ohio. The Bells' father
                Bobby and uncle Tommy were boxers. They moved to New York to train and lived in the same apartment
                building as Thelonious Monk, who became Robert's godfather. Miles Davis would drop by because he wanted
                to be a boxer.</p>

            <h3>First success</h3>
            <p>By the spring of 1973, Kool & the Gang had started to observe disco music trends, which influenced the
                band to become what Robert Bell described as "a much harder, funkier, tighter" unit than before.[21] He
                clarified that most of the group did not visit discos, and learned of disco culture from others. As a
                result of their change in direction, the band scored their first major commercial success with their
                fourth studio album, Wild and Peaceful. The album went to No. 33 on the album chart, became their first
                gold album for selling 500,000 copies, and spawned the single "Funky Stuff", which entered the Top 40
                pop chart. The next two, "Jungle Boogie" and "Hollywood Swinging", fared even better by entering the US
                top 10, marking the band's breakthrough to a white audience. The latter two songs sold over one million
                copies and were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their success
                continued with Light of Worlds (1974), which contained the hit instrumental "Summer Madness". In October
                1974, the group landed a spot on the national television music show Soul Train. In 1975, Kool & the Gang
                released Spirit of the Boogie which contained the top 40 single "Spirit of the Boogie". This was
                followed by the part-studio part-live release Love & Understanding, in 1976.</p>

            <h3>Their Peak</h3>
            <p>The group's seventeenth album, Forever, was released in November 1986. The album included two hit singles
                on the Billboard Hot 100 chart: "Victory" (US #10, R&B #2) and "Stone Love" (US #10, R&B #4). Two
                further singles, "Holiday" and "Special Way" were also released from the album; the former reached the
                top ten on the R&B Chart, the latter hit reached No. 6 on the Adult Contemporary chart. By 1986, the
                band had scored 14 top 40 singles in the US since 1980, more than Michael Jackson. In July 1986, the
                band recorded a special version of "Celebration" with different vocals that was used in an advertisement
                for Wendy's.</p>

            <p>In 1987, the band completed a 50-city tour of the US. The tour included the group establishing their own
                public service program, devised by Robert Bell and Taylor, which encouraged school children to pursue
                education, giving free tickets to those with perfect attendance. The group rehearsed their stage
                show with a choreographer at Prince's studio at Paisley Park. At the time of the tour's start, the
                band ceased producing adverts with Schlitz beer because of their new image towards children and that
                they felt it had run its course. After the tour, Taylor left Kool & the Gang to pursue a solo
                career. He returned in 1996 for their State of Affairs album.</p>

            <h4> Later Years</h4>
            <p>In February 1988, news of Taylor's departure from the band to pursue a solo career was reported in the
                press. The group had discussed pursuing solo projects during the previous year, with Thomas
                suggesting the band had considered splitting into twos or threes. Taylor was replaced by three
                vocalists: Sennie "Skip" Martin, Odeen Mays, and Gary Brown.</p>

            <p> saw the release of the band's 18th album Sweat. By this time Khalis Bayyan and Robert "Spike" Mickens
                also had departed the band. The album didn't fare well. Ron Wynn of Allmusic called the album "a
                completely faceless, aimless record ... probably the worst album of their career." Unite, the band's
                nineteenth studio album, was released in 1992. It marked the return of Khalis Bayyan to the group. In
                1995, Taylor returned to the band for State of Affairs (1996), hailed as the group's "comeback"
                album. All songs on this album were written by Khalis Bayyan and Taylor. Taylor left the band for
                the second time in 1999.</p>
